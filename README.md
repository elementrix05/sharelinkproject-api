File sharing is kinda irritating! Especially when you have to share same large bulky file to many people. Sometimes it leads to consumption of Lots of internet data and wastage of time too. To overcome this problem I came up with Sharelink! Sharelink is dynamic file sharing web app where you have to just upload file & it will generate a unique, secured, simple & small URL & you just need to share that simple URL. Anyone(who have respective URL) can download respective file using that URL. Sharelink is also mobile responsive(Thanks to CSS-media query) so users can use it from any device!
